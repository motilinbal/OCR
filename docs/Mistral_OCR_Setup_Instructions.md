## 3. **Generate Your API Key**

1. In the console, find **API Keys** (usually under Workspace or in the main menu).
2. Click **Create new key**.
3. (Optional) Give your key a name (e.g., "My OCR App Key") and set an expiry date for extra security.
4. **Copy your API key immediately!**  
   - You’ll only see it once.  
   - Click the copy button or select and copy the key string.

> ⚠️ **Keep your API key safe!**  
> Anyone with this key can use your account and spend your credits.

## 4. **Store Your API Key Securely**

- **Best options:**  
  - Password manager (Bitwarden, 1Password, etc.)  
  - Secure, encrypted note app

## 5. **Connect the API Key to Your OCR App**
